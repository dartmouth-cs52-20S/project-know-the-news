## Setup

* To get the full experience of our project you should also make use of our chrome extension - (https://github.com/dartmouth-cs52-20S/project-other-know-the-news). If you clone the extension and then 'load unpack' into chrome by navigating to (chrome://extensions/) and pressing the load unpacked button, and then following the instructions in chrome to instill the extension. 

* Requries running the API (https://github.com/dartmouth-cs52-20S/project-api-know-the-news) locally at port 9090

## Deployment

* Run yarn deploy to deploy at knowthenews.surge.sh
    * Won't work right now due to API being deployed locally
