## About

* The main goal of this project was to build a web application that would give people the ability to easily see the "other" side of a news story. Given the problem of the United States and the World becoming more polarized on political and social matters due to various reasons such as echo-chambers, we decided that this type of application would be a step in the right direction of breaking down the echo-chamber walls and giving people the ability to form their own opoinion on matters by seeing a more diverse set of opinions than they would have originally seen.


* Our team developed a chrome-extension which searches the web for news articles on the same topic of an article that a current web-user is viewing, and gives back a set of articles with a different sentiment on the same subject, therefore exposing the user to other opinions on the topic.


* Further the user has the ability to save the articles, and access them for later use on our website. Our website will host every "topic" or set of articles that anybody has saved and therefore users can access a variety of different topics on our website.

## Setup

* To get the full experience of our project you should also make use of our chrome extension - (https://github.com/dartmouth-cs52-20S/project-other-know-the-news). If you clone the extension and then 'load unpack' into chrome by navigating to (chrome://extensions/) and pressing the load unpacked button, and then following the instructions in chrome to install the extension. 

* After you have installed the chrome extension, you can navigate to any news article on any news source and use the "Fetch News" button to find other articles on the same topic but from another point of view.

* If you decide to save a topic by pressing the "Save Topic" button you can view the topic on our website listed below.

## Deployment

* project is deployed at http://knowthenews.surge.sh/
* the chrome extension is currently only in github but hopefully will get approved soon by chrome webstore and it will be officially online.
